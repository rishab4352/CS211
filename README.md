# CS211
Computer Architecture where I used C programming and researched fundamental issues in the design of modern computer systems, including the design and implementation of key hardware components such as the processor, memory, and I/O devices, and the software/hardware interface.

PA1

This was my first Assignment in my computer architecture class where we made four C functions that had different implementations. 

yell.c takes and given inputs and capitalizes them all as an output. 

Balance.c takes an input that contains brackets such as '(', '{', or '[' and balances them by matching them with their assigned closing bracket by using stack. 

Rle.c compresses a string depending on the letter given. For example, aaabbcccc, would become a3b2c4.

list.c uses pointers and struct in a linked list to organize a text input of numbers that sorts them in order.
